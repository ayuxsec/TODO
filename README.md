# TODO

- [ ] Broken link detector in pdf links
- [ ] I was hunting on a program today who had lots of `go.mod` dependencies which has open cves on them but since they were indirect or the vulnerable functions were not used i couldn't land
      a hit however, this could be automated. Think of a tool to do so.
